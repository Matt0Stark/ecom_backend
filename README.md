# Ecomm - Back end

## Description
Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by 
modifying starter code I built out the back end for an e-commerce site, and configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

my contribution can be seen primarily inside of the api routes and models folders.
